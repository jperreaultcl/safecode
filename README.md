# safecode
a library that checks whether or not you can code safely

# purpose
This libarary can be used to test whether you can write safe code that guards against multiple types of errors

# how does this work?
This repo contains a very simple project. When started, it retrieves a list of users and then loops through those users to get additional information about them, printing that info to the command line.

In order to simulate a realistic environment, each time the program runs, it will pull random users.

You have been tasked with "fixing" this code based on vague reports of "it doesn't work for me"

All of your changes should be made in the "fixme.js" file

# cheating
All the source code is here. Nothing is hidden or encrypted or located outside of this project. That means that you could choose to inspect other files to get the "correct" answer. But that would defeat the purpsose of this exercise

# run your code
To run your code, run "npm start" or "npm run start" or "node ."

# test your code
Once you think you've accounted for all possible errors, run "npm test" or "npm run test" and see how you did
